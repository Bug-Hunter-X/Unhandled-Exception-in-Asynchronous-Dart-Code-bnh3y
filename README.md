# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient exception handling within asynchronous operations. The example shows a function fetching data from an API. The `try-catch` block catches exceptions but only prints a basic error message. Real-world applications should implement better error management, including:

* **Detailed Logging:**  Record error details (stack traces, timestamps, HTTP status codes) for debugging and monitoring.
* **User Feedback:** Provide informative error messages to the user.
* **Retry Mechanisms:** Implement exponential backoff retries for transient network errors.
* **Fallback Mechanisms:** Provide alternative data sources or default values if the API call fails.
* **Error Monitoring:** Integrate with an error monitoring service to track and analyze issues.

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides an improved version with enhanced error handling.
